         <p>On November 26, 2017, <span class="custom-text">Dan Mullen</span> signed a six-year, $36.6 million contract to become the new head coach of the Florida Gators football team. ESPN ranked Mullen's first recruiting class at Florida at 13, an increase of six from the previous season. After a 4–7 campaign the previous year under coach Jim McElwain, Mullen's first Gator squad went 10–3 and finished ranked No. 7 in the AP Poll after a 41–15 victory over then-No. 8 Michigan in the Peach Bowl. He led the Gators to an 11–2 record the following year including a 36–28 win over Virginia in the Orange Bowl.</p>

         <p>In his third season as the Gators' coach, Mullen amassed an 8–3 record and the school's first ever trip to the Cotton Bowl against Oklahoma. Quarterback Kyle Trask put up record-breaking numbers, including a nation-high 4,125 passing yards and 43 passing touchdowns, the latter of which set a school single-season record.</p>

        <p>The Gators head into the year with a couple of new coaches on both sides of the football, including its quarterback coach. The team's starting quarterback last year, Kyle Trask, has moved on to greater things in the NFL with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, selected in the second round.</p>
